# WhatsApp Stickers in Kotlin

## All rights reserved to WhatsApp. You can find the original sample app here:
https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers

## Work in progress, quite a few things *TODO*.


Wanted to make a sticker app for fun an afternoon after work and this happened.

A version of the sample android app following (loosely):

- MVVM

- Dagger2-android for dependency injection

- Navigation AAC

- Kotlin coroutines


You are free to use this repo for your own project with proper attribution.

If you do use it, shoot me a message so we can showcase your app here if you want :)
