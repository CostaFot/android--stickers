# WhatsApp Stickers in Kotlin

## All rights reserved to WhatsApp. You can find the original sample app here:
https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers

## Work in progress but still fully functional. 

Wanted to make a sticker app for fun an afternoon after work and this happened.

A version of the sample android app with added goodies:

- `MVVM`

- `Dagger2-android`

- `Navigation AAC`

- `Kotlin coroutines`


You are free to use this repo for your own project with proper attribution.

If you do use it, shoot me a message so we can showcase your app here if you want :)
